The Second day was really fine enjoyed the coding and all
didn,t knew how to do the debug then gradually understood it.
The code to greet according to time was easy and I liked it
the code to check whether the number is even or not was not too bad


console.log()
it is a command in the js to show the output. We can show a function, a text, number etc

VS code debugger
in vs code debugger we can debug the codes without an external assistance. Since we are doing it inside the vs code itself it's better and easy
we can set break points at a particlar level and see the changes.
