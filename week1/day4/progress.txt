Actually I still haven't understood the whole thing about the ts since idk how to convert js into TS. sometimes ts cannot be converted into js. Even if we code everything in ts we need to convert it into js. When we create an object in ts we use the keyword interface but when i tried to convert it into js. it was empty and when i checked llm for it, they said we cannot do something like that.Same happened with the function too

 TypeScript Compiler
 it's the command-line tool that converts TypeScript code into JavaScript.

tsc myfile.ts       
tsc *.ts            
tsc 

TypeScript are explicit declarations that tell the compiler what type of data a variable, function parameter,
 or return value should be they say that whetherits a number or a string and all
