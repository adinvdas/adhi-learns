## What is Node.js?

Node.js is a runtime engine that lets you run JavaScript outside the browser.
Before Node.js, JavaScript could only run inside web browsers.
With Node.js, JavaScript can now run directly on your computer system.

Think of JavaScript as a chef who could only cook in one kitchen (the web browser).
Node.js gives the chef access to many more kitchens — like your system, desktop apps, and servers — allowing JavaScript to do more.



### Runtime Environment

A runtime environment is the place where your code runs — it provides everything needed to execute and manage programs.

For JavaScript, the browser was its original runtime.
But with Node.js, JavaScript now has a runtime on your computer system too — outside the browser.

Think of it like this:
Without Node.js, JavaScript is like driving only on highways (web browsers).
With Node.js, it’s like driving off-road — you have more flexibility and can go many more places, like servers, desktop apps, or command-line tools.


### Alternatives to Node.js

* **Deno** – A more secure and modern alternative to Node.js.
* **Bun** – A faster, all-in-one runtime that can replace both Node.js and npm.



### NPM (Node Package Manager)

NPM is a tool that comes with the Node js.
It is a package that consists of the code written by other programmers. By using NPM people don't have to build everything from the scratch and instead they can use these ready to use packages.

Think of NPM as a appstore when we want to use a particular app we install it and use it, Likewise when we need to use a package on our code we install a NPM package and use it.


## Browser Dev Tools

Browser Dev Tools are built-in features in most browsers that let you inspect, debug, and edit websites in real-time.

Think of it as an X-ray machine for websites — you can see what’s really going on inside.

### It is used to:

1. See how a website is built (HTML, CSS, JavaScript)
2. Debug errors (e.g., “Why is my button not working?”)
3. Test changes instantly (without reloading the whole page)
4. Check performance (e.g., “Why is my site slow?”)
