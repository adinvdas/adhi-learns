// the code was to show the double of the number we just gave but it turns out to be error.
//so we added console.log to see the output of the program we just gave
//and it turns out to be an error that occured due to the mistake in symbol
function dm(num){
    return num * num;
}
console.log(dm(5))
//so we create an another function
function dm2(num){
    return num + num;
}
console.log(dm2(5))
